**We have came up with a better solution, this will be depricated soon.**

Get notification when vaccine is available in your area

Download and run the .exe file if you dont have any coding knowledge or not interested in setting up python environment.

This code opens up a UI where you can type in the pin code and select the mode of notification. Once the vaccines are available, it will send the notification.
